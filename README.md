This project is made with inspiration from the tinder app.
The idea is to give you and/or your family ideas on what to eat.

For now the app will be offline and used on one phone only. 

Features: 
Add your own dish and upload an image.
Filter what you don't like and pick a category. 
Offline "multiplayer" mode. 
Create a weekly schedule and insert the chosen food.
